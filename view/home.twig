                <p>Trefelin Boys and Girls Club was formed in 1984, and has continually grown since this date with
                    strong junior and senior sections. The Club’s ethos is based on community and the development of
                    "grass roots" football to encourage and help promote children of all age groups, abilities,
                    gender, or ethnic group to participate in sport.</p>

                <p>Trefelin began playing their matches at the local park and during this period the committee
                    channeled their efforts to raise funds for a permanent home which resulted in the building of
                    the Ynys Park playing field and pavilion complex in 1996 Since its opening continuous
                    improvements have been made at the ground, and a new 100 seater stand was completed in 2019.</p>

                <p>Trefelin Boys and Girls Club have won numerous honours at senior level, the first was being
                    crowned Port Talbot league 2nd division champions in the 1990/91 season. Continued success saw
                    Trefelin become Port Talbot Premier League champions gaining them promotion into the 2nd
                    Division of the South Wales Amateur League in the 1994/95 season. In 1995/96 the club gained
                    promotion into the first division as champions, a feat which they repeated again in 2006/07.
                    Trefelin won the FAW trophy in 1999/2000 when they beat Bryntirion Athletic 6-2, and they lifted
                    the John Owen cup in 2011/2012 and 2013/2014 seasons beating AFC Bargoed on both occasions.</p>

                <p> Trefelin were promoted into the Welsh League after winning the newly formed South Wales Alliance
                    league in 2015/16. After struggling to adjust to the league during the first season, the Club
                    then missed out on promotion on goal difference during the 2017/18 season, a blow softened by
                    winning the Welsh league Cup after beating Division 1 Champions Llanelli Town, 2-1 in the final
                    at Garden Village. The Club were runners up during the 2018/19, and were promoted to the newly
                    formed Welsh league Division 1.</p>

                <p>Trefelin Boys and Girls Club currently run teams at all age groups from Under 6 through to 1st
                    Team, with an active and successful Veterans section, the Club remains committed to its
                    community ethos, and many of the players representing Trefelin Boys and Girls Club at first team
                    level have progressed via the Club’s youth system.</p>
