# Thank You

This is dynamically generated from a Google Spreadsheet to allow the organisers to easily and quickly update the site.

THANK YOU FOR OFFERING TO HELP!

The files to edit are in the `/public` directory, the html will be `static.html` and any of the css etc that is used.

The main problems currently are I have no idea how to make the logo look good on all screen sizes, and I don't know how 
to stop the title bar from going onto two lines on tiny screens (I reduced the name of the charity to BGC from Boys & 
Girls Club as my quick fix :D).

I'll take any PR that makes the site look any better!

I am so terrible at this stuff, you're help is hugely appreciated.
